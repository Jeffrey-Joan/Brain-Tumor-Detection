### Brain-Tumor-Detection

# Abstract

Brain tumor occurs owing to the uncontrolled and rapid growth of cells. If not treated at an initial phase, it may lead to death. Despite many significant efforts and promising outcomes in this domain, accurate segmentation and classification remain challenging tasks.  A significant challenge for brain tumor detection arises from the variations in tumor location, shape, and size.  The naked eye cannot detect brain tumors below the diameter of 3 mm in any MRI scans. Thus the application of deep learning in detecting brain tumors is highly significant in modern society. The major challenge in implementing this idea is to search for a suitable deep learning model and get the appropriate accuracy. The objective of this project is to design a deep learning model on brain tumor detection through magnetic resonance imaging to help the researchers. The proposed model will address all the disadvantages of manual observation and detection that are mentioned above.
